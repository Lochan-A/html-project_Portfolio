<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm A. Lochan, a 21-year-old engineering student from Palamaner, in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh. I completed my schooling in Palamaner and pursued my intermediate education in Vijayawada. Currently, I am pursuing my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) at VIT Vellore.

I come from an educationally driven familyâ€”both my parents, A. Devakumar and V. Kavitha, are passionate teachers working in a government school. Their dedication has always inspired me to strive for excellence in everything I do.

<p>As an aspiring engineer, I am hardworking, creative, and committed to continuous learning. I have a keen interest in VLSI design and Embedded Technology, and I possess a strong foundation in Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). Additionally, I am familiar with MATLAB basics, which helps me approach signal processing and system design tasks with confidence. I consider myself a quick learner who adapts fast to new technologies and enjoys solving complex problems.

I have completed a summer internship certification in VLSI design with Maven Silicon, which gave me hands-on experience and deeper insight into chip design and digital circuits. I also hold a certificate from the Udemy Web Development Bootcamp, which expanded my skills into full-stack web development.</p>

<p>I have a strong passion for electronics, especially in areas like chip design, digital systems, and hardware development. Exploring how electronic systems work at the lowest level excites me and motivates me to go deeper into the core of engineering.

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing cricket and badminton, which keep me active and energized. In my free time, I also like to play chess and video games, which help me relax and sharpen my strategic thinking.

My goal is to secure a position where I can apply my technical knowledge, grow professionally, and contribute to meaningful innovation in the engineering field.</p>
